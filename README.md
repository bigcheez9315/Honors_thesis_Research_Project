This repository ontains programs that I created during my statistics research. 
The first one calculates the conditional breakdown point of the LAD estimator on the stars data set. This is based on the algorithm 
called MIP2 in the paper GiloniPadbergSIAM on page 12.
The second program generates weights for a random 100x5 data set using the algorithm and method set forth in GiloniSimonoffSengupta, 
on pg. 5,6.
