This repository ontains programs that I created during my statistics research. 

MIP2_LAD_Breakdown_Point  calculates the conditional breakdown point of the LAD estimator on the stars data set. This is based on the algorithm called MIP2 in the paper GiloniPadbergSIAM on page 12.

Weight_Generating_Algorithm generates weights which minimize leverage points for a random 100x5 data set using the algorithm and method set forth in GiloniSimonoffSengupta on pg. 5,6.
 
LAD_Weight_Generating_Function is similar to Weight_Generating_Algorithm except that it creates a function that can determine appropriate weights for minimizing leverage for any input matrix.
